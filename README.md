# Wyrm for FoundryVTT!

Implements basic character and item sheets for playing Wyrm in Foundry VTT. Wyrm is a mashup of many systems, to include Vaults of Vaarn, Cairn, and Knave.

The code is based on the [Cairn system](https://github.com/yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT) for FoundryVTT (which in turn is based on other sytems).
